# Voxel Works Quest
This is the full source code of the prototype Oculus Quest game Voxel Works Quest (https://neospark314.itch.io/voxel-works-quest or https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/431).

As this was intended as a quick prototype for jog in place locomotion the code is not very clean yet and a lot of shortcuts were taken during development. Feel free to dig into the details here but do not expect it to be a good reference on how to build a VR game.

# Starting/Developing on Desktop
Voxel Works Quest uses a modified version of the [Godot Voxel Module](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) that needs to be compiled together with the godot engine editor.
For an easier start in getting to run this game I have included a prebuild version of the editor (windows only) with the correct voxel engine for windows in the releases of this repository. This should allow to open and run the project without the need to compile godot and the module yourself.

You can download the needed [Godot Editor here.](https://github.com/NeoSpark314/VoxelWorksQuest/releases/download/prep_initial_release/godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe).
